    "AZURA.\n\nThe laughter rang in my ears but there was nothing merry about it, filled with malice and jeers.\n\nвЂњGo on!вЂќ\n\nвЂњAwe, whatвЂ™s wrong, too much of a wimp?вЂќ\n\nвЂњYouвЂ™re meant to be the boss' woman, can't you do it? Too weak?вЂќ\n\nI freeze, standing between my boyfriend and his men. They are torturing someone who I donвЂ™t even recognize in his wolf form, but what else is new, this is the usual for them. I always tried to ignore his ways and stayed out of his business. I tried to focus on the good in him instead, but today, they expect me to join in with their sick games.\n\nI donвЂ™t want to do this, staring at the bloody mass on the ground, my stomach churns. This was not meant to happen.\n\nвЂњJust pull the trigger.вЂќ His voice is devoid of emotions, his cold murky eyes meet mine as he holds the gun out to me.\n\nвЂњI... I'm not so sure about this, this wasnвЂ™t what you told me.вЂќ I reply calmly, despite the way my stomach is twisting with nerves.\n\nвЂњNot even for me, my little Pet?вЂќ He tilts his head, looking at me whilst the rest of his friends spur me on.\n\nI stare at the gun, trying to think how I got hereвЂ¦\n\nBut I donвЂ™t know when I fell into this toxic relationship. IвЂ™m not someone who needs sympathy, I was never one who couldnвЂ™t sleep at night because of my demons. I was always carefree, unbothered, and wild. I loved to have fun, crush on the good-looking boys in my class, or whatever hot Alpha crossed my path. But nowвЂ¦ I find myself tossing and turning, trying to push the nightmares my so-called boyfriend has pulled me into.\n\nвЂњPlease, come on, letвЂ™s forget this.вЂќ I try to shrug it off, wrapping my arms around his neck and hoping he listens.\n\nHis scent fills my nose, mixed with the smell of cigarettes and drugs. His hands stroked my waist and I tried to remember the man I had fallen in love with.\n\nWhere has he gone?\n\nвЂњForget what? Oh yeah, forget what he called you? Let me rephrase that, little Pet, you donвЂ™t want to be an outcast, do you? The outsiderвЂ¦ The odd one outвЂ¦ The freak?вЂќ His tone is a cold sneer, as his eyes burn into mine.\n\nFreak.\n\nMy heart thumps as I stare at the bloody wolf on the ground.\n\nIвЂ™m not a freak.\n\nI am Azura Rayne Westwood, daughter of the previous Alpha of the Blood Moon Pack. Even though I was a child born in a way that played with the very laws of nature, IвЂ™m not a freak.\n\nI should be dead, but I'm not.\n\nвЂњFreak. Freak. FreakвЂќ His men begin to chant only making the anger rise within me. He smirks, knowing itвЂ™s getting to me, making me yank away from his hold, my heart thumps violently as I snatch the weapon from his hand.\n\nI remember when I was a child, I didn't understand why I was disliked. Occasionally there were kids in the Pack whispering behind my back, but they didn't dare to do anything to me because I was the daughter of their Alpha. Plus, I was not someone to mess with, I always made anyone who tried to hurt me or those I loved, suffer.\n\nHowever, there was one name that never left me - The Freak.\n\nвЂњDo it.вЂќ\n\nI look at my boyfriend, he knows I hate that term, but he still uses itвЂ¦ ItвЂ™s my fault, I was the one blind enough to tell him my darkest secrets.\n\nвЂњFine.вЂќ I spit as I turn, pretending to do his bidding and raising the gun.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nвЂњShoot him, Baby.вЂќ His quiet voice laced with a deadly warning, came from right behind me.\n\nMy hand shakes as I stare at the whimpering wolf on the floor.\n\nHis breathing is so shallowвЂ¦\n\nNo amount of logic makes this okay.\n\nI am not going to do this, but the urge to turn around and shoot my so-called boyfriend instead tempts me.\n\nI lower my weapon, the laughter fading as a tense silence falls at my act of disobedience.\n\nвЂњI'm not going-вЂќ\n\nI gasp when something knocks into me from behind, making me accidentally pull the trigger, the body on the ground shivers before it stills.\n\nвЂњNo!вЂќ I scream, dropping the gun, as I run to the wolfвЂ™s side.\n\nNo, no, no!\n\nLaughter follows me as I look at the wolf before me, I canвЂ™t feel his heartbeat, but he doesnвЂ™t even shift to his human form. Whatever those bullets contain, is deadly, it is so fast he couldnвЂ™t even shift back.\n\nвЂњWhy, Judah!вЂќ I scream.\n\nSilence fell as I glared at the man who stood there, his cold eyes on me. Although he said nothing, the anger in his eyes made my blood run cold. He hates to be disrespected.\n\nвЂњYou do not talk to me like that.вЂќ He whispers menacingly as he strides over to me. Grabbing a fistful of the wolfвЂ™s bloody fur, he lifted his body from the ground in one sweep. вЂњYou did this.вЂќ With those words, he throws the heavy body of the dead wolf on top of me, the weight crushing my legs.\n\nвЂњDo you feel sorry for him? Here, take care of him!вЂќ He snarls as I glare back at him. My anger rises as I try to push the body of the wolf off me. вЂњWho said you can get up, my Pet?вЂќ\n\nвЂњThis is not a joke! I'm done with you and your sick ways.вЂќ I spit resentfully.\n\nHeвЂ™s no different from all of the others, heвЂ™s worse.\n\nHis eyes darken and he grabs a fistful of my hair.\n\nвЂњOh, we arenвЂ™t done until I say we are.вЂќ He snarls menacingly.\n\nвЂњYou donвЂ™t own me, and I am not your pet!вЂќ I hiss, glaring at him with defiance.\n\nHe simply laughed loudly, as my childish words amused him, but I knew better. He was beyond angry; I had just disrespected him in front of his men. He wonвЂ™t forgive that.\n\nвЂњYeah, I will. I'm done with you.вЂќ I spit, my heart pounding with rage.\n\nHe tugged my head back violently and using the hand that he had grabbed the wolf with, he rubbed the blood over my face roughly, before shoving me onto the ground roughly.\n\nвЂњI think itвЂ™s time I show you exactly who you belong to.вЂќ He spat as he hit me across the face, making my vision darken...\n\n-\n\nI lurch upright in bed, my entire body is soaked with sweat as the memories of that night fill my mind once more. My heart is thumping violently as I look around, and it takes me a few moments to realize I am in my bedroom. Safe.\n\nTaking a shaking breath, I get out of bed and walk to the adjoining bathroom, splashing my face with water.\n\nIt has been a year since I walked away from my toxic ex, one year since I thought I was done with him for good. Until two days ago when I received a video of that night along with the message: вЂRemember that I know what you did.вЂ™\n\nMy stomach knots, feeling sick as the words ring in my head.\n\nI turned the tap off and took a deep breath, returning to my bedroom.\n\nIвЂ™m safe hereвЂ¦ right?\n\nNo matter how many times I think it over, I donвЂ™t know how I got involved with him.\n\nThe worst part is that if my parents knew, they would be more than disappointed in me, and the one thing I hate most, is letting them down.\n\nEven though my parents are no longer the Alphas, they are still highly respected, their reputation is known across the country and Dad is on the Alpha KingвЂ™s Council. He is also one of the Elite Eleven, a title that had been unofficially given to the selection of the most powerful Alphas of our time and here I am making things worse for them.\n\nI wish I never met him, and I wish I could turn back time. Glancing at the clock, I realize itвЂ™s five in the morning.\n\nI should try to get some rest. I turned the lamp off, just as my phone beeps.\n\nTensing, I frown as I stare at the sleek device. Taking a deep breath, I unlocked it and read the message.\n\nвЂCanвЂ™t sleep? Well, IвЂ™ll give you something more to think about. Come back to me or I think your entire family would love to watch all those videos. Do you want them to see exactly how FREAKY their little girl can get?вЂ™\n\nI know what other videos he means and it makes me sick.\n\nI covered my mouth unconsciously, my stomach twisting sickeningly as I glanced towards my window.\n\nHe is watching me.\n\nI walked over to the window and peered out. My heart thumps as I scan the darkness outside.\n\nNothing.\n\nI canвЂ™t see anything out of the ordinaryвЂ¦ Is he just messing with me?\n\nMy phone beep again and I look down at the new message that pops up on the screen, a message that makes my blood run cold.\n\nвЂI see you still sleep in your underwear.вЂ™",
    "The red and purple lights danced and flashed around me, highlighting the bodies of the exotic dancers on the stage. Strippers in expensive lingerie and perfume walked around serving drinks or looking for potential customers.\n\nThe dark teal booths were half-full, some with just men and women enjoying the show, whilst others enjoyed a lap dance. A few men in suits are being escorted away by dancers to the private rooms.\n\nKingdom of Sin is a human strip club in the heart of one of the busiest cities in the country, a place quite far away from my home, and the chance of running into someone I knew was unlikely. Not to mention I have used a scent disguise twice. It's a formula that would make me smell like a human to other werewolves.\n\nI didnвЂ™t want Judah to find me here.\n\nThe fact that he may have been on our Pack territory made my stomach twist, although I kept telling myself he had just guessed what I was wearing.\n\nI needed a break from my mind and those messages. The entire day I had been unable to focus on anything. To make matters worse, tonight is the Blood Moon, an occurrence that only happens twice a year. A night where unmated wolves would head to one of the Blood Moon Gatherings to see if they could scout their fated mates.\n\nI didnвЂ™t want to go, I'm done with men, and I donвЂ™t want to be tied down to anyone. After going through a relationship that was a complete failure, I had no expectations of finding my true mate, nor do I think I was mentally up for it.\n\nEven though I did want to find my mate, and deep down I want that love that I see those around me have, IвЂ™m not sure he will want me. I donвЂ™t need my heart breaking again. Although I wouldnвЂ™t admit it, IвЂ™m a little afraid of what he will think of me, how he might hate me when he learns about my past. About the skeletons in my closet, will my mate accept everything about me? Or will he simply despise me, or worse, reject me?\n\nThe tasteful music relaxes me a lot. IвЂ™m tapping my foot to the beat as I sit in a booth, staring at the dancers on the stage. Her body sways sensually to the beat.\n\nI down my glass of whisky, wishing there was something stronger here. The liquid burns my throat, my eyes stinging a little as my mind returns to the messages.\n\nThe strict no-phone policy was enforced in this club and if I had my phone with me, I knew I would be staring at it constantly thinking about the messages.\n\nI needed a break from it вЂ“ from him.\n\nNothing scares me, nothing rocks me, but something about him got to me.\n\nI pour myself another glass as a gorgeous brunette comes over, ready to entertain me, but IвЂ™m not in the mood.\n\nвЂњNo thanks.вЂќ I flash the gorgeous brunette a grin and wink.\n\nI glanced around, observing that most of those in this club were affluent businessmen. Grabbing my glass, I gulp it down.\n\nI close my eyes for a second, before refilling my glass once more.\n\nMy mind is a storm of emotions.\n\nJudah had too much on me; things he is now using to blackmail me with. I know I can just tell someone, and we could deal with this, but all my life I have just caused problems for everyone.\n\nThere is something about him that just isnвЂ™t normal, something that tells me he is more than just a werewolfвЂ¦\n\nI have drunk a lot, emptying the last drops of my fourth bottle into my glass. IвЂ™m beginning to feel it taking a little effect. This is what I neededвЂ¦ I close my eyes, letting the music envelope my senses.\n\nTonight, I just want a break, IвЂ™ll deal with the messages another dayвЂ¦\n\nI open my eyes, looking through my thick lashes at the women on stage. I love dancing, and something about pole dancing just feels empowering and exhilarating. If done right, it truly is an art. I applied for a job just over a year ago at a club near home, and I got it too, but I only managed to do one session because my brother found outвЂ¦\n\nI shudder remembering the rage in LiamвЂ™s eyes when he stormed into the club and saw the men with their eyes on me. Although I usually have him wrapped around my finger, on the rare occasions when he did get angry... well let's just say, yeah. No. Big no.\n\nDo not get Liam angry.\n\nI preferred him to stick to being an oversized dense puppy.\n\nBut heвЂ™s still my favorite.\n\nMaybe I should go dancing.\n\nI stood up, making my way over to the dance floor, which was off through a pair of double doors, running my fingers through my hair, when I froze. A familiar dangerous smell hits me, and my heart thuds.\n\nHeвЂ™s here.\n\nFear that I rarely felt envelops me, and I scan the area, wishing I hadn't worn such high heels, wanting to blend in.\n\nKeeping my head low, I pray that the scent disguiser works, I need to get out of here. I saw the hooded man by the entrance, and a shiver ran down my spine.\n\nIt is him.\n\nHe seems to be searching for something or someone.\n\nMe.\n\nSpotting a pair of doors leading to the VIP area open, a woman in a tiny skirt and revealing blouse steps out with a keycard in her hand, and it gives me an idea.\n\nShe struts to the bar and I head towards her, accidentally jumping into her. I mumble an apology as I swipe the card from her pocket.\n\nMy heart is pounding, the fear that he will find me makes me sick.\n\nWhy canвЂ™t he just let me go?\n\nI scan the card, take a discreet glance around, and slip through the doors that click open. I just needed a place to wait around until he left. If he had entered our pack, then he must have known that my bike it outside.\n\nвЂњDid you hear that?вЂќ\n\nI froze.\n\nWerewolves? I could smell them. What on earth was going on? This was a human club, right?\n\nвЂњI donвЂ™t recognize that scent, did someone sneak in?вЂќ\n\nOh no.\n\nI look around, frowning. Three corridors lead off from here. Silently I hurry down the left one and up the flight of steps, thanking the goddess for the carpeted halls to muffle my footsteps.\n\nTo my relief, I see a pair of glass doors that are standing open. I rush inside, closing them behind me and letting out a breath of relief.\n\nIвЂ™m in a large room that looks down upon the club, from here I can see everything. I was sure from down below this was just part of the mirrored design of the ceiling, they couldnвЂ™t see me.\n\nI look around the room, the floor is a glittering black marble, with two blue velvet sofas and a glass table at the center. A bar with drinks stands to the side, but no matter where you look, this room gives us the perfect view of the dance show below, without the smell of sweat or arousal hanging in the air.\n\nShould I wait around here? What should I do?\n\nGoddess, what have I gotten myself into?\n\nMy phone is in the locker too, I canвЂ™t even contact someone.\n\nSuddenly the sound of footsteps and talking reaches my ears, they are approaching fast. I glance around, my attention falling to the bar, and my heart thumps as I quickly hide underneath it.\n\nI peep out from the side, spotting several men coming closer. Two men get to the door first, holding them open for the rest. My heart sinks when I realize there are a few werewolves present as well.\n\nThey are going to sniff me out!\n\nEach man meant business, from their suits and their dangerous appearances, but it was the one in the center that stood out. Pulling my attention to him entirely.\n\nNot only is he an Alpha, but the power and dominance that rolls off him is so intense I almost forget to breathe.\n\nEveryone else seems to fade away as I stare at the man in the middle. HeвЂ™s wearing a fitted black shirt, his sleeves rolled up with black pants and boots. He holds his jacket over his shoulder on one finger and despite the darkness in the club, he wears a pair of shades. His chocolate-colored hair is short and styled back. From what I can tell his entire neck, his arms, and his hands are covered in tattoos.\n\nAnd then my heart lurches when the most intoxicating scent hits me; woody and dangerous, with the hint of blood mandarin, warm cinnamon, and patchouli. And the scent is coming from none other than the Alpha male in the center.\n\nHe pauses, tensing as he turns his head slightly.\n\nHe has smelt me.\n\nThe restlessness of my wolf and the pounding of my heart is no longer in my control. Every cell in my body is going haywire as I stare at none other than the god before me.\n\nHeвЂ™s my mate.",
    "I move back, my heart thumping. He must have heard me; he must have smelled me.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nJudah may be dangerous, but the man standing a few meters from me screams of power and danger of a far higher caliber.\n\nI need to get out of here before he sees me, but how do I do that?\n\nвЂњWe can continue this another day. Reschedule.вЂќ His deep velvety voice, which sends shivers of desire through me, came.\n\nI canвЂ™t lie that the voice is fucking hot.\n\nCome on Azura, breathe steadily and focus!\n\nвЂњAh, of course.вЂќ\n\nвЂњAbsolutely.вЂќ\n\nI didnвЂ™t dare move as I heard the rest recede, but my mate remained. The doors shut and I close my eyes in defeat, heвЂ™s still here.\n\nвЂњWhy donвЂ™t you step out from your hiding spot,вЂќ his voice has a hint of authority.\n\nI close my eyes. All the dreams I had about being able to scape from him, is gone.\n\nSlowly, I stand up and turn, staring at the man before me. If I have thought he is the epitome of desire and dominance before, he is a thousand times hotter when I see him properly. His scent intoxicates me, and I feel lightheaded as he slowly removes his shades and I look into the pair of the coldest ice-blue eyes I have ever seen. Eyes that trail over me, but give away nothing.\n\nHe is tall, maybe around six-foot-six. His muscular arms strain with his bulging biceps, I notice that he has three piercings in his right ear and one in his left.\n\nвЂњWho would have thought IвЂ™d be given a humanвЂ¦вЂќ He mutters so quietly I almost didnвЂ™t hear him.\n\nвЂњI'm not human,вЂќ I reply coldly.\n\nHe looked up into my eyes with a glimmer of interest in those cold ones.\n\nвЂњThen join me for a drink.вЂќ\n\nIt wasnвЂ™t an offer, but a command.\n\nThe very temptation to turn and run away from him consumed me, but I couldnвЂ™t. As much as I hadn't wanted to find my mate, the curiosity to know what kind of person the goddess had made for me won, and I found myself nodding.\n\nHe came over to the bar, I had to admit that his posture and attitude spoke volumes. This was a man who knew what he wanted, and he got it.\n\nThe temptation to tell him about Judah and why I was up here almost overcame me, but I couldnвЂ™t, this was not his fight and he hadn't asked why I was up here.\n\nBut something told me I had walked straight into the wolfвЂ™s den.\n\nвЂњDo you like your drink strong or light?вЂќ He asked after dropping his jacket onto the sofa.\n\nвЂњStrong, although I donвЂ™t think thereвЂ™s anything you have to offer that could work on me.вЂќ I mused, staring at the window that looked down upon the club.\n\nвЂњDonвЂ™t be so sure.вЂќ His arrogant reply came.\n\nI turned to him as he poured a green liquid into two glasses before he held one out to me.\n\nвЂњWhat is this?вЂќ I asked, looking at it curiously.\n\nвЂњAbsinthe.вЂќ He replied with a small cold smirk before he raised the glass. I clinked mine against him, looking surprised.\n\nAbsinthe...\n\nвЂњIsnвЂ™t this illegal here?вЂќ I asked, unable to stop the curiosity that seeped into my mind.\n\nвЂњBeing up here without permission is illegal too. This is the only drink that can take the edge away. Clearly, four bottles of whiskey didnвЂ™t work for you.вЂќ He remarked mockingly.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, had he seen me? I looked down below, only to see the booth I was sitting at was in plain sightвЂ¦\n\nвЂњSo you were watching me?вЂќ\n\nвЂњYou may have caught my eye. Not many women do.вЂќ\n\nI donвЂ™t miss the вЂmanyвЂ™ in that sentence.\n\nHe steps closer and I find myself looking into those dangerous eyes of his.\n\nвЂњYou wanted to run when you realized that we were mates.вЂќ\n\nHe knew.\n\nI took a sip of the alcohol.\n\nOh, this was strongвЂ¦\n\nThe taste was intense, but I liked it.\n\nвЂњI think you would be happy if I ran, I'm a nightmare you do not want in your life.вЂќ\n\nвЂњFunny that you should refer to yourself as a nightmare, you look far from one, but even I know not everything that looks like a dream is one.вЂќ\n\nI couldnвЂ™t deny the fluttering in my stomach at his words, as he downed his glass of absinthe, my eyes dipping to his Adam's apple.\n\nDamn, the boy was sizzling.\n\nI felt a clench in my core and averted my gaze.\n\nDeep down, something told me not to do this. I didnвЂ™t know anything about him but that he seemed to be the boss of this club, and that he was definitely an AlphaвЂ¦\n\nWho though? I had seen many Alphas. Ok, not really, damn I wish I paid more attention, but I didnвЂ™t care for them I was always too busy in my own worldвЂ¦\n\nвЂњYou didnвЂ™t want to find your mate. Good. Neither did I.вЂќ\n\nвЂњThen why didnвЂ™t you just walk away?вЂќ I asked.\n\nвЂњI wanted to see exactly what the Goddess created for me.вЂќ\n\nвЂњAnd?вЂќ I found myself asking, my stomach fluttering.\n\nHis Icy-blue eyes trailed over me, and I saw his flash a stunning steel blue as they fell on my breasts.\n\nIf his gaze alone could have such an effect on me, then what would his touch feel like?\n\nHe stepped closer and I found myself backing away until my ass touched the glass behind me.\n\nвЂњIf weвЂ™re going on looks alone, better than expected.вЂќ\n\nMy core throbbed at his words. How did someone I had just met have such an intense effect on me?\n\nHe cut me off by placing the back of the hand that held his glass against my lips.\n\nThe crazy fireworks that erupted from his touch were dizzying, sending a dangerous jolt to my core.\n\nIt made senseвЂ¦ all of it, the way the mated couples around me were so love-crazed, all they wanted was to be next to their mates. Just a single touch from someone I didnвЂ™t even know was driving me nuts, and I was unable to stop myself from softly kissing the fingers that were pressed against my lips.\n\nHis eyes flashed a steely blue as our eyes met, and the moment he removed his hands, I slowly licked my lips, before taking another sip of the strong alcohol. Turning my back to him, I stared down at the club below, my core was throbbing, and I knew if I drank this entire glass I would be pretty high. I saw him pour himself another glass and down it in one before he placed it on the bar counter and walked back over to me.\n\nI looked at him once again, turning towards him as he stepped closer, this time the gap between us was almost non-existent. I could smell his addictive scent, feel the heat from his body, and the steady beating of his heart, all of it consumed me.\n\nвЂњTwo glasses and you seem perfectly sober, I'm impressed,вЂќ I whispered, trying to break the intense sexual tension that was ripping me apart with desire.\n\nHe rested his arm against the glass above my head, forcing me to back up against it.\n\nвЂњI didnвЂ™t think you would be that easily impressed.вЂќ His eyes stared down at me, and I noticed his thick lashes.\n\nI could picture waking up to this hunk every dayвЂ¦\n\nвЂњI do have pretty high standards in some departments,вЂќ I replied haughtily, staring into his eyes.\n\nThe faintest smirk crossed his lips as he ran the knuckles of his free hand down my waist, making my heart thump in anticipation. His body was barely inches from mine and the urge to press my thighs together was incredibly strong.\n\nвЂњGood, letвЂ™s just hope you can handle me.вЂќ His seductive reply came.\n\nWe were chest to chest, and he parted my legs with his knee, making my core clench.\n\nвЂњShall we try and see?вЂќ I asked seductively, a challenging glint in my eyes.\n\nHe may be an Alpha, but I wasnвЂ™t just anyone.\n\nStill holding my glass, I locked my arm around his neck, pressing myself against him, placing my free hand on his abs.\n\nвЂњConfident.вЂќ He mused, running his fingers up the side of my waist still so tantalizingly slow, the urge to moan overwhelming me but I kept it in.\n\nвЂњIncredibly, I am not a submissive little good girl.вЂќ\n\nвЂњSee the thing isвЂ¦вЂќ he trailed off, smirking as he pressed his body against me. вЂњGood girls get fucked and bad girlsвЂ¦ bad girls get punished. Which is it going to be?вЂќ\n\nHis tone made me bite my lip, my arousal scenting the air and I knew he could smell it.\n\nвЂњThen youвЂ™re going to have to punish me, Alpha,вЂќ I whispered, hooking my fingers into his belt and pulling him against me, just as he grabbed my hair.\n\nHis lips met mine in one incredibly mind-blowing hungry kiss, that sent pleasure erupting through my body. Tingles and sparks rippled through me wave after wave as his lips dominated mine, fuelled by power, hunger, and desire. A kiss that was out of this world and one that I knew had ruined all men for me.\n\nI heard my glass shatter as it hit the floor behind him, but neither of us cared.\n\nHis plush lips were heaven and sin all at once, and I found myself fighting for dominance, our tongues dancing against one another as our hands traveled over the otherвЂ™s bodies, feeling and groping every inch that we could get our hands on. His tongue was pierced and the sensation of it felt so damn good.\n\nMy body was on fire, my pussy clenching at his touch. It was rough yet sensual, turning me on so strongly that I was unable to hold back the sounds of pleasure that left my lips. I moaned, feeling his huge, hard cock press against my stomach.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nI wanted to pull his pants down and take his cock in my mouth, but before I could even begin to undo his belt, he pulled back, his eyes a dazzling steel blue.\n\nвЂњLetвЂ™s get the fuck out of here.вЂќ He growled huskily, breathing hard as he looked me over.\n\nI nodded, not needing to be told twice. I wanted him here and now.\n\nOh goddess, I'm done for.",
    "AZURA.\n\nWe took the back exit where a sleek black car had been waiting for us. I didnвЂ™t see the driver, my focus was on the man before me. The moment we were in the car, he pulled me on top of him. I straddled him, welcoming the feeling of intoxication he brought.\n\nI didnвЂ™t need ten bottles of whiskey or several glasses of absinthe to forget everything, this workedвЂ¦\n\nHe pulled my jacket off me, and I helped; reaching behind and pulling it down from my wrists, and then tossing it to the ground. His eyes were on my breasts, his hand running down my arms. I locked them around his neck, tangling one hand through his delicious chocolate locks.\n\nOh fuck, he was so handsome.\n\nOur lips met once more in a sinful kiss. I gyrated my hips against his crotch, his grip tightened on my waist, the other squeezing my ass.\n\n\"Fuck.\" He growled, sucking on my neck.\n\nI tilted my head back, my eyes fluttering shut as rivers of pleasure rocked through me. His hand twisted in my hair as his lips trailed down my collarbone; kissing, sucking, nipping at my smooth skin.\n\nHe grabbed my breast, making me swear in pleasure. I didnвЂ™t want any items of clothing between us, but just when I thought heвЂ™d yank my top down, the car came to a stop.\n\nThe door was opened for us and I realized we were in an underground car park. His hands never left me, and I was not bothered that the suited man who had opened the door was right there. Instead, he carried on kissing my shoulders and neck roughly as he guided me to the lift. The moment his thumbprint was scanned, the doors opened and he pushed me up against the wall of the lift, pressing a button before he had my wrists pinned against the wall, his lips meeting mine once more.\n\nI moaned into his mouth, feeling his hard shaft against me.\n\nOh fuck.\n\nWhen the doors opened, we carried on making out passionately as he guided us down the hall and through to a bedroom.\n\nThe feeling of his hands on me was like a slice of heaven itself, any logic or sense of self was gone. All I wanted was him, it was all I craved.\n\nThe bedroom door opened and the cool air-conditioning touched our heated skin. I pulled open the buttons of his shirt, wanting him naked.\n\nThis place smelled of him and I loved it.\n\nFor a moment, I pulled away, staring down at the fully tatted body of the god before me.\n\nOh fuck, he was totally drool-worthy, the type of guy me and my girls would strip for any day.\n\nEvery ridge and curve of his body was chiseled to perfect, his Adonis belt dipped into his belt and my hands instantly went there, raking down his abs. With the other I pulled his shirt off completely, just as he grabbed my neck, pulling me closer and kissing me once more whilst I began working to take his belt off.\n\nHis hands reached for the hooks on my top and undid them swiftly.\n\nSomeone was an expert.\n\nHis eyes raked over me as he grabbed my breasts, squeezing them as he kissed me harder. The moment I had his zip down, I pulled away from his perfect lips. As much as I wanted to keep on kissing him, I wanted something else between my lipsвЂ¦\n\nI crouched down sexily, keeping my eyes locked with his steely blue ones, and undid his pants, yanking them down. My long black nails grazed his hips, my core throbbing when I looked at the sight before me. Ink covered his V-cut and thighs, spreading over his hips. There were words and quotes alongside the images that I was curious to learn about, but not as much as I wanted to see the monster of a cock that he was packing. I pulled his boxers down his muscular thighs.\n\nHe was perfectly groomed, just the way I liked it, with just a sprinkle of trimmed hair. His balls were hard, and as for his cockвЂ¦ not only was it fucking huge, putting any that I had seen to shame, but there was also a ladder of piercings running along the entire underside of the shaft right up to the mushroom tip. Ten perfect parallel bars.\n\nOh, Goddess.\n\n\"WhatвЂ™s the matter? Never see a Jacobs ladder before?\"\n\n\"No.\" I found myself saying as I wrapped my hands around it and began stroking it.\n\nHis head tilted back slightly, but his eyes still held mine as I stuck my tongue out, licking the tip where a pearly white drop of pre-cum sat, begging to be sucked off.\n\n\"Fuck.\" He swore the moment I wrapped my lips around him and began sucking him harder.\n\nI had never seen a man look hotter while in the throes of pleasure than the one above me.\n\nHis hair wasnвЂ™t as slick as it had been when I first saw him, thanks to me running my fingers through it on the way here. It was now a hot, smoking mess, one that only made me want to yank it even more.\n\nHis eyes found mine, his hand pulling my hair as he began thrusting into my mouth faster.\n\nI almost gagged, breathing through my nose and relaxing as his dick hit the back of my throat. My lips fully stretched around him burning at the friction, he was huge, and this felt so good. His body tensed as he began thrusting harder, shoving his dick fully down my throat roughly. I choked as he pulled out, making me gasp for air, only for him to ram it down my throat again.\n\nI moaned against him, my pussy aching for more.\n\nHe swore pulling out and, with a few swift strokes, came all over my breasts. I stuck my tongue out, making it obvious what I wanted, and he tapped his cock on it, making me whimper as I tasted his salted caramel-like cum.\n\nOh, I wouldnвЂ™t mind making this my favorite dessert.\n\nA sexy smirk crossed his lips, and he yanked me up, kissing my neck as he quickly unzipped my pants, pulling them down in one swift movement. Crouching down, he peeled my panties off, taking a moment to admire me down there before his tongue flicked between my pussy lips.\n\n\"Oh fuck!\" My head hit the wall behind me and my entire body shook with electrifying holts of pleasure as his tongue flicked my clit, his ball piercing only adding to the sensation.\n\nOh goddess, this wasвЂ¦\n\nHe lifted my leg and unashamedly I draped it over his shoulder, threading my fingers through his hair as I became lost in the pleasure of his touch. I wish I didnвЂ™t come this fast, I wanted to revel in this pleasure for so much longerвЂ¦.\n\nThe moment my release hit me, he pulled away, standing and yanking me into his arms as he shoved his tongue into my mouth, allowing me to taste myself as my body convulsed in pleasure. I could barely focus, the aftermath of that sizzling orgasm rocking me.\n\nI gasped for air as I clung to him.\n\nHis hands cupped my ass, squeezing hard as he lifted me. I locked my legs around his waist, feeling his cock brush against my pussy, sending a dangerous jolt through me.\n\nHe pushed me up against the wall just as he thrust into me.\n\nI gasped, feeling the pressure of having something so fucking big in me.\n\nDamn, my dildo did not compare.\n\n\"Fuck.\" I groaned, burying my head into his neck.\n\n\"Good thing youвЂ™re not a virgin.\" He whispered huskily, as he began fucking me hard and fast.\n\nHe kissed and nibbled on my neck, sucking hard and adding to the euphoria I was feeling. I couldnвЂ™t respond, even when we somehow ended up on the bed, his hands all over me as he fucked me senseless. I couldnвЂ™t focus on anything but the sheer bliss of the moment.\n\nThis was heaven.\n\n\"Fuck.\" He growled.\n\nWas he trying to pull away?\n\nI wasnвЂ™t sure but I didnвЂ™t want him to move away.\n\nMy hand intertwined in his hair as I met his powerful brutal thrusts with my own, each time burying him deep within me. His piercings only heightened the pleasure that he was inflicting me with.\n\n\"Harder, I can take it. DonвЂ™t hold back.\" I moaned, feeling the pressure reaching the biting point.\n\nHe obliged, fucking me harder and faster than I thought possible. I screamed in pleasure, unable to stop myself.\n\nA moan of pure ecstasy escaped me and I felt something pierce my neck, sending another bolt of pleasure and pain through me.\n\nHe wasвЂ¦ marking meвЂ¦\n\nI didnвЂ™t care, this pleasureвЂ¦ another moan left my lips as I arched my neck, allowing him better access.\n\nHe growled as he fucked me roughly, his teeth sank into me completely, triggering my release and I cried out hornily, my back arching off the bed.\n\nMy eyes rolled and my vision darkened, as the most intense mind-blowing orgasm consumed me. The bond strengthened and it felt like I was about to faint.\n\nI heard his grunt as he finished with a few rough thrusts, our juices mixing and our bodies coming down from their highs.\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\nWas that anger?\n\nI was too lightheaded to focus but I turned my head to look at him.\n\nHe was looking at my neck and the sudden realization that I was marked hit me.\n\nGoddess, I was marked.\n\n\"ItвЂ™s fine,\" I murmured breathlessly, wondering if it was the fact that he had marked me without even telling me that was making him react like that.\n\nHis ice-blue eyes seemed to hold some conflict, but I was too tiredвЂ¦ Letting the darkness welcome me, I felt him pull out, and I thought I felt his lips brush the mark on my neck, sending a shiver through me before getting off the bed, but I wasnвЂ™t sureвЂ¦ I just wanted to sleepвЂ¦\n\n-\n\nI wasnвЂ™t out for long; I opened my eyes, feeling refreshed despite the ache that now remained between my legs. I looked around, realizing he was still in the bathroom; I could hear the shower was on.\n\nI needed to get his name. Goddess that had beenвЂ¦ perfect.\n\nI had forgotten all about Judah and now it all returns, but somehow it doesnвЂ™t take away from the night I had just had.\n\nI sit up, pulling up the bed sheet as I look around for something to put on, although my body just wants to succumb to the darkness once more. The bathroom door opens, and the inked god steps out, wearing nothing but a pair of pants.\n\nFor a moment he reminds me of Alejandro Rossi, the Lycan king himself.\n\nI shake my head, pushing the thought away, why did the King even come to my mind?\n\n\"Are you just going to stare?\" He asks, tossing the towel he has been holding onto the bed.\n\n\"Well, I thought you just marked me as your mate, but I still donвЂ™t know your name,\" I remark, about to get off the bed, but the moment my feet hit the floor I realize they feel like lead, and so IвЂ™m simply forced to sit there.\n\n\"You still donвЂ™t know who I am?\" He says, taking out a grey T-shirt.\n\nI looked at him curiously, only for those icy blue eyes to meet mine.\n\n\"No, I just know youвЂ™re an Alpha.\"\n\nHis aura seems to change, and I can feel his anger through the bond.\n\n\"Soon to be Alpha.\" His voice was filled with venom, and I looked at him in complete shock.\n\nHis aura is impressive, how was he not an Alpha yet?\n\n\"Soon to be?\" I ask curiously.\n\n\"Just tell me whatвЂ™s your name?\" He asks instead, bringing me out of my thoughts.\n\n\"I still didnвЂ™t get yoursвЂ¦\"\n\n\"Leo. Leo Rossi.\" He replies coldly, making me freeze.\n\nMy eyes widen in shock as my head snaps to the man before me.\n\nNo wayвЂ¦\n\n\"Leo Rossi?!\" I jump off the bed, almost falling to the floor. I grab the towel and wrap it around myself as I stumble over to him. \"How did I not see it?!\"\n\nHe frowns, stepping back just as I cup his face, feeling his stubble graze my fingertips.\n\n\"Oh, Dante is never going to let me live this down! Oh my god, a Rossi? What will Dad think?!\" My head was spinning, but I couldnвЂ™t deny the sliver of excitement that rushed through me at the thought of being mated to him.\n\nMe and my sister Kiara would be mated into the same family! Oh, goddess! What would Dad think realizing that both of his daughters are mated to tatted, pierced Rossis? My poor dad! And then-\n\n\"Who are you?\" His voice is quiet, yet deadly, and I freeze mid-thought, glancing back at him.\n\n\"You donвЂ™t recognize me?\" I ask touching my fresh mark.\n\n\"Should I?\"\n\nMy smile falters at the hostility in his tone.\n\nI know Leo had distanced himself from the Rossisholds to the point he was never around. Marcel, his father, still held the Alpha title although Leo runs the pack, refusing to allow Leo to take over. The feud between Leo and the rest of the Rossi was from years ago, and it was obvious it remained.\n\n\"Azura, Azura Rayne Westwood.\" I state, no longer smiling as I look at him seriously.\n\nHis eyes flash dangerously as they run over me, his heart is thudding, and when his eyes return to mine, I only see blinding rage in them.\n\n\"Westwood. Is Selene for real?\" He almost spits. \"I knew it was too ideal.\"\n\n\"WhatвЂ™s wrong with be-\"\n\n\"Being a Westwood? Sure, one of the Elite Packs right? Entitled bastards who are free to do whatever they want.\" He stepped back, eyes that had held desire and interest now hold nothing more than hatred.\n\n\"Hey, thatвЂ™s not fair-\"\n\n\"I, Leo Rossi, future Alpha of the Sangue pack, reject you, Azura Rayne Westwood as my Mate and Luna.\"\n\nI freeze as the violent ripping pain tears through me and a scream leaves my lips. Burning pain grips my neck where my mark sits and I fall to my knees. He mated with me, marked me, and then rejected me, causing the pain to be even worse than an instant rejectionвЂ¦\n\nI canвЂ™t breathe, the intensity of the pain in my neck is burning. I claw at my neck, my heart beating harshly.\n\n\"I will never accept the daughter of an Elite as my mate.\" His cruel words are faint and far, my vision darkening slightly. I look ahead, seeing him walking away.\n\nOnly one truth screams in my head leaving me completely devastated.\n\nRejected.\n\nHe had rejected me.",
    "AZURA.\n\nFour weeks had passed since his rejection. That night had shaken me far more than anything Judah had ever done to me. I still remember grabbing my clothes before I stumbled out of the penthouse. I had nothing, not my phone, not my bike. I had managed to beg someone for a phone, and I had rang Liam as the rain began falling, washing away the scent of my so-called mate. But it couldnвЂ™t wash away what he did to me. My mark burned with agony, the healing slowing due to the rejection.\n\nWhen Liam had shown up, I had been silent. When he saw the state I was in, the anger in his eyes had made me succumb to tears. I had never seen him so enraged, and if I didnвЂ™t grab onto him and beg him that it was consensual, he was ready to kill. I had managed to tell him that my mate had marked and rejected me. If it was anyone else but Leo, I wouldnвЂ™t have cared, but I couldnвЂ™t tell anyone because it would ruin things. Alejandro would lose it and Marcel, LeoвЂ™s dad, would feel guilty over it. This involved my entire family, not just me. I just couldnвЂ™t.\n\nI now clutched at my neck, where his mark stained it. It had taken a full week for it to heal.\n\nFrustration and anger filled me as I stared at the message on my phone.\n\nJudah.\n\nHe was a problem that still didnвЂ™t go away and he, like the rest of my pack, had found out I had been marked and rejected. His anger had been clear in his messages and he had begun to ring me too. Calls I refused to answer, which only made his threats worsen.\n\nThe Blood Moon and its sister pack, the Blue Moon, combined were over four thousand members. We literally shared the same territory, although the residency homes were separate. Years ago, we were like this pack of people living in the woods, weird right? Yeah, tell me about it, but now, we had a mini town here; shops, a restaurant, cafГ©s, even a school, and of course a huge hospital. Somehow word of me being marked had still travelled like wildfire, even though I had tried to keep it a secret.\n\nMy markвЂ¦ a crescent, shimmering, midnight blue moon, with stars and a lotus, set against a background of blue flames. A beautiful mark with an equally ugly story too. A reminder of the painful memories I wanted to remove.\n\nI still remember the look on DadвЂ™s face when Liam had brought me home, the way he had hugged me, the way his heart was thumpingвЂ¦ MamaвЂ™s pain, the worry and anger in her blazing eyes. I had to stay quiet for everyoneвЂ™s benefit, but they only got angry at me for refusing to share his name. I still hadn't said the words to accept his rejectionвЂ¦ I knew I didnвЂ™t need to be face to face to do so, but still, it was daunting.\n\nEverything had made me sick; I had lost my appetite and I was unable to focus on anything. I needed a break from it all, I wanted to run awayвЂ¦ and although Liam told me it wasnвЂ™t the answer, I still wanted to.\n\nA light knock on my bedroom door made my head jerk up.\n\n\"Hey Zu,\" LiamвЂ™s voice came, concern clear in his magnetic blue eyes.\n\n\"Hey.\" I replied, picking up my jacket and slipping it on.\n\n\"Were you going out?\" He asked.\n\nI nodded as he stepped into the room, wrapping his arms around me tightly. I closed my eyes, hugging him back, his familiar scent reminding me of home. I wanted to cry and throw a tantrum for him to fix. But I wasnвЂ™t a child anymore, and this wasnвЂ™t his problem to deal with. He had enough to handle with six kids and a pack to take care of.\n\n\"Talk to me Zu.\" He whispered, kissing the top of my head.\n\nI didnвЂ™t reply, simply hugging him tighter.\n\n\"Am I your favourite sister, Liam?\" I asked, looking up at him, using my best doe eyes on him and trying to sound cute.\n\nHe smirked, amused, and cupped my face, kissing my forehead.\n\n\"Without a doubt.\" He gave me a wink and I smiled.\n\n\"YouвЂ™re my favourite too.\" I said quietly, taking a deep breath as I stepped back. \"Do you know where my old collection of voodoo dolls are that I didnвЂ™t want to throw away?\"\n\nHe looked at me worriedly. \"Umm, are you really going down that path?\"\n\n\"I am tempted to learn some dark magicвЂ¦ I think I wouldnвЂ™t mind causing a few people some pain.\" I'm sure I had a Leo Voodoo doll somewhere.\n\nLeo Rossi.\n\nA man who was known to be ruthless, cutthroat, and dangerous.\n\nA man whose heart was frozen in ice.\n\nA man who cared for no oneвЂ¦\n\nI had heard the stories, but what he did just made them all seem very realвЂ¦\n\n\"IвЂ™m going to head out for a bit.\" I told Liam, before I grabbed my bike keys and left the house.\n\nI rode through the streets of our small town. Maybe some pastries from Granny JuneвЂ™s might cheer me up. Luckily for me, today was her day off. She hated me, and I disliked going there if she was around. I parked my bike, ignoring the looks that a group of girls who were sitting at the outside table gave me, and entered the bakery.\n\nAll five of those barbie dolls had gone to school with me, and well I canвЂ™t deny that I did prank them once, ok maybe twice? LetвЂ™s just say we no longer got onвЂ¦\n\nIt was a harmless prank, I swear.\n\n\"WeвЂ™re closed.\" A grumpy voice came.\n\nJust my luck.\n\nGranny June was here.\n\nI looked around the bakery, it was definitely not closed. Three of the old crones who hated me were here too.\n\nPerfect. I wish I had checked with Justin before coming here.\n\n\"Leave, youвЂ™re dirtying my floors.\" She growled.\n\n\"Aw, come on Granny June, my shoes are clean. I'm only here for a few pecan pies then I'm out.\"\n\n\"Leave.\"\n\n\"You knowвЂ¦ the faster you give me those pastries, the faster I'm out of here?\" I slipped my hand into my jacket pocket and pulled out my wallet.\n\n\"No, IвЂ™ve ran out. I donвЂ™t serve frвЂ¦\" She pursed her lips, looking me over with barely disguised contempt, knowing if she said those words, it would be direct disobedience to her Alpha.\n\nFreaks of nature.\n\nThat was what she always liked to mumble. We may be in a time where we lived in peace amongst witches, although most of the pack were absolutely fine with witches and the way I was born there was still the handful who didnвЂ™t change and didnвЂ™t approve of how I was born. Usually where I would snap back at them with everything I had lately I had just had enough.\n\n\"Well then, I will wait here until someone shows up to serve me.\" I crossed my arms.\n\nThe smell of the various baked goods suddenly made me sick.\n\nMaybe I should just leave.\n\nShe tensed and I saw her eyes dart to the window, as if checking if anyone who may support me was around.\n\n\"I have nothing to give you.\" She said suddenly, picking up the tray of freshly baked croissants she had brought out and walking into the back kitchen, slamming the door behind her.\n\n\"I donвЂ™t understand why we have to tolerate her.\" One of the hags muttered from behind me.\n\nI didnвЂ™t bother to look in their direction. I sighed, my smile fading before I turned away, pushing open the bakery door. The urge to find some bugs to infest the bakery tempted me, but I didnвЂ™t have the time nor the will to do so.\n\nNote to selfвЂ”make a Granny June voodoo doll.\n\nI stepped out into the fresh air, my stomach lurching nauseatingly, about to get on my bike.\n\n\"No wonder she was rejected. No one would want her. SheвЂ™s a psychotic freak.\" I heard an old woman who sat at the table outside with her mate, mutter.\n\nI swear if it wasnвЂ™t for how good Granny JuneвЂ™s bakes were I would avoid this place, all the same type of people gathered here.\n\nDonвЂ™t do this now.\n\nMy anger was rising, and I knew I was on the brink of losing control.\n\nDonвЂ™t.\n\nI got onto my bike, trying to ignore them.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely a freak.\" The old man grumbled.\n\nI froze, my head snapping towards the couple who had spoken.\n\n\"Want to say that again?\" I growled menacingly.\n\n\"I said nothing, pup, move along.\" He growled standing up.\n\n\"DonвЂ™t lie. Say it again.\"\n\n\"I said I said nothing.\"\n\n\"I SAID SAY IT AGAIN!\" I screamed, not caring that two passer byes had stopped and were staring at me.\n\n\"Azura come-\"\n\n\"No! if you want to call me a freak, then say it to my fucking face!\" I screamed, cutting off whoever had tried to stop me.\n\nThe older manвЂ™s face turned an angry shade of red as he glared at me.\n\n\"ThereвЂ™s no such thing as respect around here! I said nothing!\" He lied as everyone shook their heads in disapproval.\n\nMy chest heaved, my emotions a turmoiled mess as I looked around.\n\nThese people knew me growing up, and although they were silenced, recently since my rejection they were becoming vocal once more. June and one of the other hags came to the door watching me with contempt, disapproval, and irritation.\n\n\"SheвЂ™s so dramatic.\" One of the girls from the academy muttered.\n\n\"I'm not dramatic.\"\n\n\"You shouldnвЂ™t lie, dear.\" The elderly woman at the table scolded gently with fake sympathy in her eyes as she stood up taking her mateвЂ™s arm. \"It doesnвЂ™t look good on your parents.\"\n\nYeah, I get it, IвЂ™m a failure and a disappointment to them too.\n\n\"I didnвЂ™t lie.\" I retorted defensively; my emotions were getting out of control as I stared at the man whose face held the tiniest of smirks. \"You know exactly what he said.\"\n\n\"I said nothing. Stop trying to get me in trouble.\" He scoffed, walking off.\n\n\"Hey!\" I shouted, getting off my bike.\n\nI stormed over to the old penis.\n\nI was about to grab him when a hand grabbed hold of my wrist and stopped me.\n\nI was ready to lash out when I looked into the eyes of one of my thirteen-year-old nephews, Renji.\n\n\"Come on Azura, letвЂ™s go home.\" He coaxed gently.\n\n\"I donвЂ™t want to go home; I have things to do.\" I growled.\n\nвЂњDad wonвЂ™t let this slide, donвЂ™t worry no one will get away with this.вЂќ He said clearly, about to pull free from his hold, but the look of concern in his soft blue eyes made me close my eyes and nod in agreement.\n\n\"ItвЂ™s no big deal this bunch of wrinkles will never change, donвЂ™t tell Liam.вЂќ I said quietly not wanting to cause him more work.\n\nThey were already concerned over my mark and rejection. He nodded hesitantly and I gave him a small smile.\n\nвЂњI'm just going out of the town for a bit. I promise.\"\n\nRenji, the sweetest angel of the quintuplets. I knew if it was anyone else, I wouldnвЂ™t have listened. He believed me and nodded.\n\nвЂDonвЂ™t let them get to you.вЂ™ One of the two passer byes said through the link.\n\nвЂI never do.вЂ™ I got back on the bike as the woman gave me a warm smile and I flashed her a grin before casting a deathly glare at the old, wrinkled vaginas before getting back onto my bike, feeling super nauseous. Revving the engine, I suddenly froze. For the last week or so I had been feeling like thisвЂ¦ As a werewolf, I should have healed from any cold by nowвЂ¦ My heart thundered as I quickly rode out of the pack territory.\n\nA sudden and terrifying thought occurred to me, and the fear of the possibility of it enveloped me.\n\nPlease no.\n\nThirty minutes later, I was in a public stall at the drugstore. I held a stick in one hand, my eyes shut as I counted the seconds before taking a deep breath and looked at it.\n\nMy stomach sank when I saw the two clear lines that stained the test.\n\nI was pregnant.",
    "AZURA\n\nPregnant. I slide to the floor against the stall wall, not caring about the germs that probably fill this place, and stare unblinkingly at the stick, my mind blank.\n\nPregnant.\n\nWith his child.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I say, taking a shuddering breath.\n\nI am not fine.\n\nI'm pregnant. I'm only nineteen, and I'm pregnant.\n\nPregnant with the child of someone who wants nothing to do with me.\n\nI know I will have to tell my parents, but the thought makes my stomach sink. The hurt in DadвЂ™s eyes when I told him I had been rejectedвЂ¦ I donвЂ™t know if IвЂ™ll be able to handle telling them I am pregnant, too. What do I do?\n\nMy mind is reeling, and the pain in my chest is becoming suffocating. As much as I want to crush Leo for what he has done, I canвЂ™t, not without making this hard for Alejandro. I canвЂ™t do that to them. IвЂ™ve already caused problems for everyone without meaning to.\n\nThere was a time I dreamt of a love like my parentsвЂ™, but who am I kidding? My mate ripped that from me when he marked me, only to reject me. A true mate's markвЂ¦ it can only be removed if he marks another or if he dies and someone else marks meвЂ¦ but unless that happens, I am stuck with this. I clutch my neck, letting my nails dig into it as I slowly look down at my stomach. I drop the stick, placing my hand over it.\n\nIt is not this babyвЂ™s faultвЂ¦ it is not at faultвЂ¦\n\nI was meant to have died before I was bornвЂ¦ there is no chance on earth that I would do anything to this baby. I close my eyes, taking deep, steadying breaths.\n\nI'm fine.\n\nI guess it is time to tell Mama and Dad about the pregnancy. I just hope they donвЂ™t try to push for a name. Standing up, I gather the rubbish, binning the pregnancy test before I wash my hands and leave the washroom. Time to tell them and get this over with.\n\n-----\n\nNight has fallen, and I am sitting in the lounge with Mama and Dad. I am curled up between them. Mama has her head resting on my shoulder whilst Dad is running his fingers through MamaвЂ™s hair. His head is resting on top of mine. We are watching a movie, and although I have a lot of chances to drop the bomb, I am unable to tell them.\n\n\"WhatвЂ™s wrong, baby? YouвЂ™re really quiet,\" Mama asks, lifting her head and looking at me with concern in her gorgeous sage-green eyes.\n\n\"IвЂ™m fine.\"\n\n\"Is this about the run-in with Olson earlier?\" Dad asks. So they know about my run-in with that old penis.\n\n\"You heard about that? Were you just going to pretend it never happened?\" I ask, feeling upset for no reason. Are they going to just walk around on eggshells now because I have been rejected?\n\n\"ItвЂ™s not like that. Liam will deal with him. Gemma Kingston told us what happened. Rest assured, they will be questioned about it and dealt with. There is no tolerance in these packs for that behaviour,\" DadвЂ™s icy reply comes. It is obvious he is pretty pissed.\n\nI get up from the sofa, running my fingers through my hair, only for it to fall back in my face again.\n\n\"I donвЂ™t need anyone to be dealt with. I just want to be left alone! I can handle my battles,\" I say, feeling frustrated. I can feel my emotions rising, knowing IвЂ™m going to lose it soon.\n\n\"Azura, this isnвЂ™t just about you, it's about everything, and their attitude is not right. WhatвЂ™s wrong, baby? Tell me,\" Mama asks, coming over to me as she places her hands on my arms. She is a lot shorter than me, and I am wearing heels whilst she is barefooted, making her look even smaller.\n\nDo I tell them? How, when I know they already want to kill him for rejecting me? I donвЂ™t want to see that pain in DadвЂ™s eyes againвЂ¦\n\n\"ItвЂ™s nothing,\" I say, trying to pull away, but Mama refuses to let me go.\n\n\"Azura. Something is wrong. What is it?\" She asks, her eyes flashing silver and her voice holding a quiet warning, a tone that tells me she is not going to back down.\n\n\"I said it's nothing! Leave me alone, for the love of the goddess!\" I shout in frustration, my eyes flashing the very same colour as hers. I see the flash of hurt in her eyes, but along with it is the determination that she never lost.\n\n\"Now, Azura,\" she growls.\n\n\"Please,\" LiamвЂ™s quiet voice comes.\n\nI look up to see him standing with his Bite-Sized Luna by his side. Her long black hair with blue tips is pulled into a high ponytail as she looks at me with concern in her unique eyes. One blue, one green.\n\nI close my eyes, my head pounding as I gather the courage to speak up.\n\n\"I'm pregnant. There,\" I declare before I push past Liam and Raven, leaving all four of them stunned.\n\n\"Zu!\" LiamвЂ™s voice comes, and I hear him on the steps.\n\nFuck, he is fast.\n\nI speed up, reaching my bedroom and slamming the door shut behind me just as he catches up. I hear him swear as he taps lightly on it.\n\n\"Come on, Azura, talk to us,\" his voice calls.\n\nI stay silent, pushing myself away from the door, walking over to the bed, and dropping onto it on my stomach. I just want the ground to split open and swallow me whole.\n\nMy phone beeps, and I stare at the glow from it as it sits on my bedside table. I dread every incoming message these daysвЂ¦\n\n\"Azura, open up, come on.\"\n\n\"I'm tired, Liam,\" I reply.\n\n\"Please?\" DadвЂ™s voice makes me close my eyes in frustration. How do I say no to him?\n\nI get to my feet and unlock the door, only for Dad to envelope me in his warm embrace. My heart squeezes, feeling guilty for causing him to worry. I look up at him.\n\nDad may be sixty, but he looks as if he is in his mid-forties. Werewolf genes at its finest, and on top of that, he is one of the most handsome men I have seen. Even if not by bloodвЂ¦ he is my dad.\n\n\"Why did you run?\" He asks, raising an eyebrow. I look away, wondering where Mama and Raven are. Is Mama angry?\n\n\"I messed upвЂ¦\" I say, turning my back to him and dropping onto my bed.\n\n\"He was your mate, and things happenedвЂ¦ besides, it kind of reminds me of Kiara and Alejandro.\" He gives me a small smirk, although it doesnвЂ™t take away the concern in his eyes, and my heart thuds at the mention of them. I have heard their storyвЂ¦ but this is differentвЂ¦\n\nLiam comes over and drops onto my bed, wrapping his arms around my shoulders.\n\n\"Trust me, you are definitely getting off easier,\" he whispers, making me smile.\n\nOf course I am. Everyone knows I am spoiled in comparison to Kia and Liam.\n\n\"Scooch over. Make some space for me,\" Dad says. Liam and I shuffle over, allowing him enough space to sit down on the bed. He runs his fingers through my hair. \"I donвЂ™t know why, but I feel like thereвЂ™s a reason you arenвЂ™t sharing his identity.\" I tense, but with Liam holding me in a tight bear hug, I am unable to escape.\n\n\"Do we know him?\" Mama asks as she enters along with Raven, holding a tray of hot drinks for the four of them and a glass of milk for me. She places it down on my cabinet near my bed, right next to my phone, which sits silently for now.\n\n\"You guys know everyone,\" I reply smoothly as Raven sits down cross-legged on the end of the bed, giving me a vibrant smile.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" She asks as Mama sits next to her.\n\nHow do I feel? A mess.\n\n\"I donвЂ™t know.\"\n\n\"Whatever you decide to do, we are here. As for that bastardвЂ¦ if I ever find out his nameвЂ¦\" Dad leaves his threat hanging, his eyes flashing a cobalt blue. And thatвЂ™s exactly why I will never tell you.\n\n\"So, whereвЂ™s Katara? With the boys?\" I ask, referring to Raven and LiamвЂ™s youngest child. She is seven years old and their only daughter after five boys.\n\n\"Yes. Jayce isnвЂ™t happy, but they have no choice,\" Raven replies.\n\nTheir house is not far from ours. From my bedroom window, I can see the side of their house. They begin talking, and although I know they are just there for moral support, I am unable to join in with the conversation. Even when Dad passes me my glass of milk, I am unable to think of anything but my own turmoil. No one mentions the pregnancy until everyone finally leaves my room after I tell them I want to rest. Mama looks at me as she picks up the tray of empty cups.\n\n\"WeвЂ™ll go to the doctor tomorrow, or would you prefer Kiara to come down?\" She asks quietly.\n\n\"I donвЂ™t want anyone to know yetвЂ¦ justвЂ¦ for a little while. I just want to process it all,\" I mutter, trying to sound nonchalant. Mama nods before she kisses my cheek and leaves the room.\n\nI lock the door after them and drop onto my bed once more, staring at the ceiling, my mind a stormвЂ¦\n\n-----\n\nI awake with a start, looking around my room. The light is still on, and I realise I fell asleep without even showering or changing.\n\nWhat has awoken me? I rub my head as my phone screen lights up once again. I reach for it and unlock it, seeing the message from an unrecognised number. That same sickening feeling settles into the pit of my stomach as I look at the message.\n\n'Congratulations on the new addition. We both know we canвЂ™t have you carrying anyone elseвЂ™s pup but mine.вЂ™\n\nFear envelops me, and my hand goes to my stomach. I may not have heard a heartbeat nor seen the tiny blimp on a sonography screen, but there is a life within meвЂ¦ I look over at the window, wondering how he found out.\n\nI need to keep this baby safe.\n\nFor the first time, I decide to reply. I take a deep shuddering breath and type a message.\n\nвЂWhat do you want?вЂ™\n\nвЂYou know what I want. Let's speak in person.вЂ™ His response comes almost instantly.\n\nвЂYeah, letвЂ™s meet and get this over with once and for all.вЂ™ I text back, feeling my anger rising. I want to kill him.\n\nвЂNow thatвЂ™s more like itвЂ¦ I miss you. Meet me at our favourite place tomorrow at midnight.вЂ™\n\nвЂNo. LetвЂ™s meet somewhere more public,вЂ™ I reply. I am not going to risk this pupвЂ™s life.\n\nвЂScared?вЂ™ I frown, about to text when another message comes. вЂWe meet where I say, my pet.вЂ™\n\nI am not his fucking pet.\n\nвЂFine.вЂ™\n\nI grit my teeth, feeling so damn pissed.\n\nI toss my phone down and stand up. Going to my wardrobe, I take a small suitcase out from the top shelf and begin filling it with clothes. I need to leave, at least until I have had this baby. I am not going to stick around, nor am I going to risk its life. I am getting out of here."
